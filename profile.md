# Your GitHub Profile

Find your GitHub profile page at `https://github.com/USERNAME`,
replacing `USERNAME` with your GitHub handle.


## Add a README to your profile

([See an example of a profile with a README](https://github.com/tobyhodges).)

1. Click the `+` symbol, next to your profile picture at the top right of the
   GitHub window, and choose _New repository_.
2. In the _Repository name_ field, type in your GitHub username.
   A green box should appear below the field, telling you that this repository name
   has a special meaning.
3. If you want to, add a description for the repository, e.g. a job title or
   personal motto.
4. Make sure the visibility is set to _Public_.
5. Check the _Add a README file_ under _Initialize this repository with:_
6. Click _Create repository_.

Now navigate back to your profile page and you should see the content of
the `README.md` file in that new repository, displayed near the top.
The Markdown content of the `README.md` is rendered for display on the profile,
meaning that any text formatting etc that you encode in the Markdown source of
that file will be displayed accordingly (`**bold text**` as **bold text** and so on).

Use this personal README to tell other people about yourself and your work,
so that they can learn more about you when they click on your profile from a
pull request, issue, etc.


## Organization Visibility

If, like me, you work for an entity with a presence on GitHub
and/or contribute to other projects that exist within an
_Organization_ on GitHub,
you might be a member of one or more of these organizations.
You might have noticed a section called _Organizations_ on the left side of
the window, on your GitHub profile page.
When you are logged into GitHub,
this should show any organizations that your account has been added to.
By default, however, our membership of these organizations is not
publicly visible.
(Don't believe me? Try reopening your profile page in a private browser window.)
You can configure your profile, to choose which organizations to make visible to
the rest of the world,
but the place to make this adjustment is surprisingly difficult to find!

Here is what to do if you would like to make your membership of an organization public:

1. First go to that organization's page.
   A good way to do that is to click on the organization's logo in the
   _Organizations_ section of your profile page
   (remember you need to be logged in to see these).
2. Now click on the _People_ tab, next to _Repositories_ near the top of the window.
3. Click in the _Find a member_ box and type your username until you can see
   your account in the listing.
4. Click on the grey text that says _Private_ and choose _Public_.

You will need to repeat the steps above for every organization you are a member of,
that you would like to be publicly visible on your profile.
